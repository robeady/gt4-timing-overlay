# GT4 Timing Overlay

This project implements a live timing HUD for Gran Turismo 4, so you can see live gaps to other cars.

It works by reading the memory of the game running in the PCSX2 emulator in 32-bit mode.

It can be run as a standalone window or injected as a HUD into the render loop of the emulator.

## Dependencies

Injector.exe is required from the 32-bit version of injector v1.1.12 https://github.com/nefarius/Injector

## Usage notes

see do.cmd for available tasks
